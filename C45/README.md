## C45

This sub-directory holds program files for an EViews add-in that will implement the popular [C4.5 algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4.5_algorithm).

The goal of this add-in is to return the C4.5 splits as EViews objects, usable as potential RHS variables
in econometric models, preferably those with categorical (e.g. binary) outcomes.
